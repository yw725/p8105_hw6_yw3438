## Problem 1

``` r
birthweight = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female")),
    frace = factor(recode(frace, "1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian",
                   "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other", "9" = "unknow")),
    malform = factor(recode(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present")),
    mrace = factor(recode(mrace,  "1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian",
                   "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other"))
  )
```

To set up a regression model for birth weight,
