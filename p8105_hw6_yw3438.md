## Problem 1

``` r
birthweight = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female")),
    frace = factor(recode(frace, "1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian",
                   "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other", "9" = "unknow")),
    malform = factor(recode(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present")),
    mrace = factor(recode(mrace,  "1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian",
                   "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other"))
  )
```

The birth weight is an outcome that may depend on ‘mother’s weight gain
during pregnancy’ and ‘mother’s race’. We fit the initial model in the
following code.

``` r
fit = lm(bwt ~ wtgain + mrace, data = birthweight)
# read the results of the model
fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "^mrace", "Race: ")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term               |  estimate | p.value |
| :----------------- | --------: | ------: |
| (Intercept)        |  2897.455 |   0.000 |
| wtgain             |    11.360 |   0.000 |
| Race: black        | \-197.362 |   0.007 |
| Race: puerto rican |  \-77.906 |   0.319 |
| Race: white        |   115.768 |   0.112 |
